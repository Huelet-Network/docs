## Ready to get started?
Awesome! Since the creator program is in super alpha, you've probably been invited here. I've probably got in touch with you over email or twitter. If I haven't and you're interested, please dm me on discord as Litbelb#4112
## Setting up the uploader
First, you'll have to create a [Microsoft Azure account](https://signup.azure.com). Don't worry, you don't have to pay anything. When you've done that, please DM me letting me know. I'll add you to the directory, so that you can upload things to Azure.
## Ok, got that.
Great. Now you can literally upload anything!  
Because of the way huelet.net works, and it's moderation status, each video will have to be manually reviewed and created, so please allow 2-3 days. I'll email and/or DM you when it's completed.
## What's next?
Next, we reccomend [creating your profile](https://docs.huelet.net/cc/design-my-profile). Otherwise, just enjoy the fact that your video is there on the internet.
